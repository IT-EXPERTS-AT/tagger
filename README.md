# Tagger 

## About
This project contains `taggercore` and `taggercli`.

The taggercli helps with two main use cases:
 - finding resources in your AWS account and compare it to a certain tagging schema
 - applying a tagging schema to resources   
 
Taggercore provides utility classes for scanning an AWS account and tagging resources.

Please take a look at the individual README files for further information.
